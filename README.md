# BitcoinMaker (call it ./maker.sh)
A bash script to make it easy to compile and package bitcoin, altcoins. Designed for Kryptofranc.

When you ared compiling your altcoin 100x time a day, and redeploy it again and again, you need a command line tool that will setup everything for you. 

Here it is, for me it is a HUGE time saver. Adapt it to your need. It is freeware.
